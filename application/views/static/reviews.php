					Very helpful hosts who replied to all my queries pre arrival promptly and comprehensively. 
					Excellent instructions on how to get there and gain entry on arrival. As we were arriving in Edinburgh well before the check in time of 3pm we had arranged to drop our bags earlier but on arrival found the apartment all 
		ready for us- very impressive. The apartment was impeccably clean with all facilities as described. The location is great just off Grassmarket with lovely pubs 1 min away and only a few more mins up to the 

		Royal Mile etc. The ingenious pull down bed was comfy and allowed the apartment to remain spacious if required during the day. All in all a really nice place to stay.

							Stoil was very responsive and flexible about check-in time, which made a huge difference for us. He has a 

beautiful place, right in the center of everything you want to do when you're in Edinburgh. We loved the 

location! You really can see the castle from the window--right next to the fireplace. The room was always 

warm and it was incredibly clean and comfortable. I cannot recommend this flat enough.

						This was a perfect location, and the flat was exactly as shown/described. Close to everything I wanted to 

see, safe, and friendly neighborhood. The flat was completely prepared, very clean. Unexpected touches 

like a blow dryer, and tea were a welcome sight at the end of a long journey to get there. Before I arrived, 

Stoil answered my many questions quickly and fully. Excellent local recommendations, directions to the 

flat, picking up keys etc. This was my first Airbnb experience and I was thrilled. I recommend this location 

and host fully. I'll be returning!

							The apartment has an excellent location, and is within walking distance to the castle, train station, and
shops. The apartment is very clean and well equipped and you feel right at home. The host's instructions were also very clear, and he responses quickly to your messages. It is a highly recommended place to stay in Edinburgh!

						We were made to feel incredibly welcome. The apartment was just as described and we were incredibly surprised by its location. Being right in the centre of the city made it very easy to get around. Not to mention being situated next to the best Ice-cream shop in town! I don't feel as though I can recommend the Rose Residence enough. Beds were comfortable, clean and overall a pleasure to spend time in. Whilst we chose not to use the kitchen, tea and coffee was provided and had we been staying longer we would have been able to happily cook for ourselves. Luckily, the apartment is only a short walk away from both grocery stores and quaint cafes. We will be back!

					We had a great stay at Stoils apartment. As the doormat says "home away from home". Communication was good, check in smooth. Apartment as shown if not better. Awesome view of Edinburgh castle (we were lucky enough to be there the night of the fringe festival fireworks, great view without leaving home). Everything you would need to cook at home plus the little essentials. The washing machine was a real bonus. Location is perfect for exploring, close the pubs and a supermarket right on the corner. Will definitely be back. Thank you Stoil and Yavor.

					What an amazing weekend in Edinburgh at the Fringe Festival! This flat was exactly as described online and in pictures, clean, spacious and with all the amenities you could need for a weekend away. The location was brilliant, right in the middle of the city centre, steps away from the Royal Mile and Castle! The check in procedure was incredibly detailed and helpful which made the entire arrival/leaving process stress free. Will hopefully be back soon!
