				<h3>Stoil Ivanov</h3>
				<p>Founder</p>
				<p>Perhaps the Bulgarian with highest number of reviews on Airbnb!
                    Stoil is actively involved in managing holiday let properties and his work is split between the capital
                    city of Scotland and the coastal resort areas of Black Sea.
                    He has graduated Civil Engineering at the University of Edinburgh and he is also currently involved in several other small start-ups.
                    Stoil greatly enjoys being both a host and a traveller across Europe.</p>
